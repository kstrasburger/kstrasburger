      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
       My name is Kristine Strasburger, and this is my horse, CDC Lexi. I've had her since she was a week old. We are best buddies.</p>
      <p>
        I am currently a full-time online student working on a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Information Technology at Arizona State University. I'm hoping to continue with a Masters degree in Education to further develop my ability to use GIT to inspire learning. Ultimately, my goal is to develop the skills and knowledge I need to find employment in the digital age.</p>
      <p>My free time is spent caring for and riding horses. I compete in a sport called Working Equitation. I travel to Portugal about once a year to enjoy the country and take riding lessons in that sport. I also do a lot of trail riding. Horses have been a big part of my life since I was a kid.</p>
      <p>I have lots of experience building websites using WYSIWYG editors, and have learned how to make edits in HTML from that experience. I've used Markdown quite a bit years ago. Everything I know about those things are self-taught. My classes at ASU are the first formal training I've had in this area, and I'm excited to be learing the things I've become painfully aware of my shortfall in.</p>
      <p>Although I have a LinkedIn account listed in my profile here, I have not added a link to it on this page because I don't use it for anything.</p>
